A C# WPF desktop application built using the MVVM architectural pattern for real-time monitoring and visualization of network entities (e.g., pressure gauges). The system processes asynchronous data streams from a simulator and implements advanced UI features, including a Drag&Drop network grid for visual entity arrangement and programmatically drawn custom graphs to display historical measurements. The core focus was on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, delivering comprehensive contextual help, keyboard shortcuts, and robust input validation tailored for the novice user profile (CG5).
